# Language Learning Platform ðŸŽ“

This project is a simple language learning web application developed using the following technologies and tools:

- [Angular](https://angular.io): A framework for building modern web applications.
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com): A framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io): A state management library for Angular based on Redux principles.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org): An open-source tool for building and documenting UI components in isolation.
- [Nx](https://nx.dev): A powerful set of tools for Angular monorepo development.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Software for automating the deployment and management of applications in containerized environments.

## Project structure
